                      What began as a focused dream has grown into one of India’s most respected names in public seating. Like a seed nurtured with intent, SR Seating has evolved into a brand that shelters, supports, and stands the test of time.

                        <br/>   
Today, Amit’s hands still shape what SR Seating builds, guiding designs, processes, and above all, philosophy. His belief in quality without compromise continues to anchor the company as it scales with purpose and integrity.
